This module has been heavily documented and will work as-is/out of the box. You can try it out here:

	--live-scene link has been depreciated, new hosting service is being researched--

Or you can download the scene and run it locally (ensure you have the DCL SDK installed). 

File Overview:

	-game.ts: demo of on-start code
	-dict.ts: library for lists and dicts
	-nftGallerManager: manages displayers and NFT objects across the scene
	-nftFrame: objects used to display individual NFTs (deployed by manager)
	-nftDisplayData: data definitions for placing displayers and NFTs around the scene (loaded into manager)
	-nftDisplayObjectData: data definitions for displayer types (to be used by nftDisplayData)

You can find more information inside each of these files.

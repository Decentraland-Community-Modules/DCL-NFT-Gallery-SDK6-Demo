# Decentraland_Gallery

This module provides users simple interfaces for displaying NFTs. It includes functionality 
for 2D frames, 3D objects, and node-based displayers that can bundle both types.
  
This module has been heavily documented and will work as-is/out of the box. You can try it out here:

	https://decentraland-gallery-showcase.vercel.app/

or by downloading the scene and running it locally (ensure you have the DCL SDK installed). 

File Overview:

	-game.ts: demo of on-start code
	-dict.ts: library for lists and dicts
	-nftGallerManager: manages displayers and NFT objects across the scene
